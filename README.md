phonebook
=========

Small CLI phonebook app in Go under 2 hours, with some tests. Just a short prep workshop at Hacker School. It ended up being good, because I've spent a lot of time writing code for Programming Pearls, and less time doing CLI stuff in Go. I had to pick up a couple different little things that I didn't hit yet, since my PP code is mostly test driven.
